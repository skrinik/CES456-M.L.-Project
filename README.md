# Image Classification: Comparing Deep CNN Architectures on COCO and CIFAR 100
### CSULB CES456 Course Project
#### Sean Krinik & Luis Cervantes

### COCO Dataset:
The annotations, images and the API must be downloaded from a Google cloud bin via zip from their site -> [COCO Download](http://cocodataset.org/#download). Unfortunately, you will need to download these on your own, as the data set is very large and cannot be included in this repo. If you decide to clone the repo and run, do make sure to change the directory paths for saving models!

### CIFAR 100
The data set is download via Keras so this script can be downloaded and ran locally via cloning this repo - just change paths for saving stuff :)

### *In This Repo*:

We have two iPython Notebooks with annotated output from our model training process. These files, `coco_1.ipynb` and `cifar100_1.ipynb` are both saved from an iPython notebook, run on a Google Cloud instance with CUDA, GPU enabled.

Please refer to these files for our analysis.

Our supplemental paper with in-depth comparisons and overview of the project will also be uploaded **once graded** in a future commit.

Thank you for your interest and consideration!
