# Image Classification: Comparing Deep CNN Architectures on COCO and CIFAR 100
### CSULB CES456 Course Project
#### Sean Krinik & Luis Cervantes

### *In This Repo*:

We have two pairs of iPython Notebooks & HTML files with annotated output from our model training process. These paired files, `coco_1.html/ipynb` and `cifar100_1.html/ipynb` are both saved from an iPython notebook, run on a Google Cloud instance with GPU enabled.

Please refer to these files for our analysis.

Our supplemental paper with in-depth comparisons and overview of the project will also be uploaded once graded in a future commit.
